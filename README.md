# Chalkstone Council Issue Reporting System

A comprehensive platform for the Chalkstone Council to manage public issue reporting, tracking, and analysis. The system allows residents to report issues (such as potholes, graffiti, street lighting problems), track their status, and enables council staff to manage and analyze issue data.

## üåü System Overview

This project consists of two main components:
- **Frontend**: React-based web application for residents and council staff
- **Backend**: Go (Golang) REST API with PostgreSQL database and MinIO for image storage

### Key Features

- **Interactive Issue Map**: View reported issues on a map with location markers
- **Issue Reporting**: Submit issues with descriptions, locations, and images
- **User Authentication**: Different permissions for public users and council staff
- **Staff Dashboard**: Analytics and management tools for council employees
- **Image Management**: Upload and view images associated with issues
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor the progress of reported issues

## üîß Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (>=14.0.0) and npm (>=6.0.0)
- Go (>=1.19)
- PostgreSQL (or Docker)
- MinIO (or Docker)

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the backend directory**:
```sh
cd backend
```

2. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file with database and MinIO credentials:
```
# Database
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=your_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=chalkstone
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

# MinIO Storage
MINIO_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9000
MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=minioadmin
MINIO_SECRET_KEY=minioadmin
MINIO_BUCKET=my-bucket
```

3. **Run Dependencies with Docker** (optional):
```sh
# PostgreSQL
docker run --name chalkstone-db -e POSTGRES_USER=your_user -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password -e POSTGRES_DB=chalkstone -p 5432:5432 -d postgres

# MinIO
docker run -p 9000:9000 -p 9090:9090 -d --name minio \
  -e "MINIO_ROOT_USER=minioadmin" -e "MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=minioadmin" \
  quay.io/minio/minio server /data --console-address ":9090"
```

4. **Build and Run**:
```sh
make build
make run
```

The backend API will be available at http://localhost:8080.
Swagger documentation: http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:
```sh
cd frontend
```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
```sh
npm install
```

3. **Configure Environment**:
   Create a `.env` file:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
```

4. **Start Development Server**:
